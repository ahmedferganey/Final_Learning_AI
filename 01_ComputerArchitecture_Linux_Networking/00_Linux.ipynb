    "\n",
    "### **Mount Points and Devices**  \n",
    "Linux allows external and logical drives to be made accessible by mounting them at directory paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Linux, the concept of **mount points** and **devices** is essential for managing how filesystems are accessed and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Are Mount Points?**  \n",
    "- A **mount point** is a directory where an external storage device or a filesystem is made accessible to the Linux operating system.  \n",
    "- In Linux, all files and directories are part of a single directory tree, starting from the **root directory (`/`)**.  \n",
    "- Any additional storage device, like a USB drive or another hard drive partition, must be attached (or \"mounted\") to a specific location in this directory tree before it can be accessed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of Mount Points**:\n",
    "- `/mnt`: A generic mount point for temporarily mounting filesystems.  \n",
    "- `/media`: Commonly used for automatically mounted removable media (e.g., USB drives, DVDs).  \n",
    "- `/home`: Can be a separate partition mounted as the home directory for user data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Are Devices?**  \n",
    "- In Linux, **devices** refer to the hardware components (e.g., hard drives, USB drives, CDs) represented as files in the `/dev` directory.  \n",
    "- These device files allow the operating system and users to interact with the hardware.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Device File Types:\n",
    "1. **Block Devices**: Used for hardware like hard drives, SSDs, and USB sticks.  \n",
    "   - **Example**: `/dev/sda1` represents the first partition of the first hard drive.  \n",
    "2. **Character Devices**: Used for devices like keyboards or serial ports.  \n",
    "   - **Example**: `/dev/tty0` represents the first terminal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mounting Process**\n",
    "1. **Mounting a Device**:  \n",
    "   To use a storage device, it must be mounted to a mount point. This associates the device (e.g., `/dev/sdb1`) with a directory (e.g., `/mnt/usb`).  \n",
    "   - Command:  \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - `sudo`: Grants the necessary administrative privileges.  \n",
    "     - `/dev/sdb1`: The device file representing the storage device.  \n",
    "     - `/mnt/usb`: The directory where the filesystem will be made accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unmounting a Device**:  \n",
    "   When done using the device, it must be unmounted to safely detach it or avoid data corruption.  \n",
    "   - Command:  \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     sudo umount /mnt/usb\n",
    "     ```  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Mounting Is Necessary**  \n",
    "Linux uses a **virtual filesystem** that integrates all files and directories into a unified directory tree. This structure:\n",
    "- Avoids treating drives as independent \"volumes\" (like C:, D: in Windows).  \n",
    "- Makes it possible to access multiple devices seamlessly under one root directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Without mounting:\n",
    "- The OS wouldn't know where in the directory structure the external device's filesystem should appear.  \n",
    "- The storage device would remain inaccessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Practical Example**\n",
    "1. **Check available devices**:  \n",
    "   To see which devices are connected to your system:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   lsblk\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\n",
    "sda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk \n",
    "├─sda1   8:1    0   512M  0 part /boot\n",
    "└─sda2   8:2    0 931.0G  0 part /\n",
    "sdb      8:16   1  14.9G  0 disk \n",
    "└─sdb1   8:17   1  14.9G  0 part \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mount the USB drive:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Verify the Mount:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the mount status using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "df -h\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n",
    "/dev/sda2       931G   90G  841G  10% /\n",
    "/dev/sda1       512M  128M  384M  25% /boot\n",
    "/dev/sdb1        15G  7.5G  7.5G  50% /mnt/usb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Unmount the USB drive:**\n",

    "### **Partition Category in Linux**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Linux, partitions are subdivisions of a storage device (like a hard drive or SSD) that allow the system to logically separate data and organize it efficiently. Partitions are a critical concept in managing filesystems, enabling multiple operating systems, or creating dedicated spaces for specific tasks (e.g., swap, boot, home). Here's a detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is a Partition?**  \n",
    "A **partition** is a segment of a storage device that acts as an independent storage unit. Each partition can be formatted with its own filesystem (e.g., ext4, NTFS) and serves as a building block for Linux's directory structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Partitions**  \n",
    "1. **Primary Partitions**:  \n",
    "   - Can be up to **4 primary partitions** on a single storage device using the MBR (Master Boot Record) partitioning scheme.  \n",
    "   - Used to hold operating systems or critical data.  \n",
    "   - One of the primary partitions can be marked as **bootable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extended Partition**:  \n",
    "   - A special type of primary partition that acts as a container for additional partitions.  \n",
    "   - Required when more than 4 partitions are needed (on an MBR disk).  \n",
    "   - Cannot directly store data but contains **logical partitions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Logical Partitions**:  \n",
    "   - Reside inside an extended partition.  \n",
    "   - Used to bypass the 4-primary-partition limit in MBR.  \n",
    "   - Each logical partition can function as an independent storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **GPT Partitions** (GUID Partition Table):  \n",
    "   - Modern partitioning standard replacing MBR.  \n",
    "   - Supports up to **128 primary partitions** without the need for extended/logical partitions.  \n",
    "   - Designed for disks larger than 2TB and provides better data integrity.\n",
