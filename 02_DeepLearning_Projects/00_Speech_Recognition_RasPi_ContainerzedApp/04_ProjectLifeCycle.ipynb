    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a **containerized AI voice-controlled automotive assistant**. The system will allow drivers to interact with their vehicle through voice commands. The voice input will be captured via a **microphone connected to a Raspberry Pi**, converted to text, processed using a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) model**, and then the extracted commands will be sent to a target embedded system via the **CAN bus**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective is to integrate **voice recognition, AI decision-making, and communication with embedded vehicle systems**, all deployed in a **containerized Docker environment** for flexibility, scalability, and ease of deployment.\n",

    "## **Key Features**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Voice Input Capture**: The system captures voice input from the driver through a microphone connected to a Raspberry Pi.  \n",
    "- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: The captured voice is converted into text using advanced speech recognition libraries.  \n",
    "- **AI Command Extraction with RL**: Using a **Reinforcement Learning model**, the system will analyze voice inputs, process them, and extract actionable commands from the driver's intent.  \n",
    "- **CAN Bus Communication**: Commands extracted by the AI are sent securely over CAN bus to the target embedded system in the vehicle.  \n",
    "- **Dockerized Deployment**: The entire AI pipeline (speech recognition + RL model + communication logic) is containerized using **Docker**, allowing seamless deployment on Raspberry Pi.  \n",
    "- **Real-Time Operation**: The system is optimized for real-time processing and interaction to ensure smooth operation during driving scenarios.  \n",
    "- **Vehicle System Integration**: Integration with the vehicle's embedded systems for command execution (e.g., opening doors, controlling climate settings, or playing media).  \n",
    "- **Edge-Optimized AI Processing**: The RL model and voice processing will run locally on edge hardware (Raspberry Pi) for low-latency decision-making.  \n",
