    "# Networking Simulation Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "To experience networking with real hardware or software on your PC, here are a few practical options that simulate real-world network connections:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Localhost Server Simulation with Pythonâ€™s HTTP Server\n",
    "You can simulate a real server on your computer by running a simple HTTP server that mimics a remote sensor or API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start a Local Server\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -m http.server 8080\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Python Client to Connect to Local Server\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import socket\n",
    "\n",
    "host = 'localhost'  # Connect to local server\n",
    "port = 8080\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    with socket.create_connection((host, port)) as sock:\n",
    "        print(\"Connected to localhost server\")\n",
    "        request = \"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: localhost\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\n",
    "        sock.sendall(request.encode('utf-8'))\n",
    "        response = sock.recv(4096).decode('utf-8')\n",
    "        print(\"Server response:\\n\", response)\n",
    "except ConnectionError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Connection failed: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This example connects to your localhost server and fetches the directory contents. Modify the server to respond like a sensor by sending specific data..\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Interacting with a REST API\n",
    "If you want to experiment with a real web service that acts like a data provider, many free APIs are available for testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenWeather API**: Provides real-time weather data.\n",
    "- **CoinGecko API**: Provides cryptocurrency prices.\n",
    "- **JSONPlaceholder**: A free fake online REST API for testing and prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Connecting to OpenWeather API\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "api_key = 'your_openweather_api_key'\n",
    "city = 'London'\n",
    "url = f\"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    response = requests.get(url)\n",
    "    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors\n",
    "    data = response.json()\n",
    "    print(f\"Weather in {city}: {data['weather'][0]['description']}, Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}K\")\n",
    "except requests.RequestException as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"API request failed: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example pulls weather data for a specified city and provides hands-on experience with JSON data handling, HTTP requests, and working with a simulated sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Using MQTT for Real-Time Messaging\n",
    "\n",
    "MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is commonly used in IoT applications to communicate with real sensors. Using Eclipse Mosquitto as an MQTT broker, you can simulate a sensor network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Install Mosquitto\n",
    "- **On Ubuntu**: `sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients`\n",
    "- **On Windows**: Download the installer from the [Mosquitto website](https://mosquitto.org/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Start the MQTT Broker\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mosquitto\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 3. Use Python to Publish and Subscribe to MQTT Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "This code example demonstrates how to use Python with `paho-mqtt` to simulate an MQTT client that both publishes and subscribes to a topic, effectively simulating a sensor and its data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define event callbacks\n",
    "def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):\n",
    "    print(\"Connected to MQTT broker with result code \" + str(rc))\n",
    "    client.subscribe(\"sensor/data\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def on_message(client, userdata, msg):\n",
    "    print(f\"Received message: {msg.payload.decode()} on topic {msg.topic}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up MQTT client\n",
    "client = mqtt.Client()\n",
    "client.on_connect = on_connect\n",
    "client.on_message = on_message\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to the broker and subscribe\n",
    "client.connect(\"localhost\", 1883, 60)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Publish and subscribe to sensor data\n",
    "client.loop_start()\n",
    "client.publish(\"sensor/data\", \"Test data from simulated sensor\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "MQTT lets you simulate both a publisher (the sensor) and a subscriber (the client), enabling real-time message handling. This setup is very close to networked applications in IoT and sensor networks."
