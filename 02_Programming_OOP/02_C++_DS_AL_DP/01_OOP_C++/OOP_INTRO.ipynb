    "Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as \"class members\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects.\n",
    "---\n",
    "Class Methods\n",
    "Methods are functions that belongs to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to define functions that belongs to a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside class definition\n",
    "Outside class definition\n",
    "In the following example, we define a function inside the class, and we name it \"myMethod\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You access methods just like you access attributes; by creating an object of the class and using the dot syntax (.):\n",
    "---\n",
    "Constructors\n",
    "A constructor in C++ is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a constructor, use the same name as the class, followed by parentheses ():\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The constructor has the same name as the class, it is always public, and it does not have any return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructor Parameters\n",
    "Constructors can also take parameters (just like regular functions), which can be useful for setting initial values for attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following class have brand, model and year attributes, and a constructor with different parameters. Inside the constructor we set the attributes equal to the constructor parameters (brand=x, etc). When we call the constructor (by creating an object of the class), we pass parameters to the constructor, which will set the value of the corresponding attributes to the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like functions, constructors can also be defined outside the class. First, declare the constructor inside the class, and then define it outside of the class by specifying the name of the class, followed by the scope resolution :: operator, followed by the name of the constructor (which is the same as the class):\n",
    "---\n",
    "Access Specifiers\n",
    "The public keyword is an access specifier. Access specifiers define how the members (attributes and methods) of a class can be accessed. In the example above, the members are public - which means that they can be accessed and modified from outside the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if we want members to be private and hidden from the outside world?\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, there are three access specifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "public - members are accessible from outside the class\n",
    "private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class\n",
    "protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes. You will learn more about Inheritance later.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Encapsulation\n",
    "The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that \"sensitive\" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must declare class variables/attributes as private (cannot be accessed from outside the class). If you want others to read or modify the value of a private member, you can provide public get and set methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Private Members\n",
    "To access a private attribute, use public \"get\" and \"set\" methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Encapsulation?\n",
    "It is considered good practice to declare your class attributes as private (as often as you can). Encapsulation ensures better control of your data, because you (or others) can change one part of the code without affecting other parts\n",
    "Increased security of data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Inheritance\n",
    "In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the \"inheritance concept\" into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "derived class (child) - the class that inherits from another class\n",
    "base class (parent) - the class being inherited from\n",
    "To inherit from a class, use the : symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why And When To Use \"Inheritance\"?\n",
    "- It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multilevel Inheritance\n",
    "A class can also be derived from one class, which is already derived from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "A class can also be derived from more than one base class, using a comma-separated list:\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Specifiers\n",
    "You learned from the Access Specifiers chapter that there are three specifiers available in C++. Until now, we have only used public (members of a class are accessible from outside the class) and private (members can only be accessed within the class). The third specifier, protected, is similar to private, but it can also be accessed in the inherited class:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism means \"many forms\", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, think of a base class called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Derived classes of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "In C++, the virtual keyword is used to indicate that a method or function in a class can be overridden in a derived class. It is primarily associated with polymorphism, allowing you to work with objects of different derived classes using a pointer or reference to a base class and ensure that the correct method implementation is called at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts of virtual:\n",
    "Virtual Functions: A function in a base class that is declared with the virtual keyword can be overridden by derived classes. When you call a virtual function using a base class pointer (or reference), the derived class's version of the function is executed, even if the pointer or reference is of the base type. This is called runtime polymorphism or dynamic dispatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding: When a derived class provides its own implementation of a base class's virtual function, this is called overriding. The virtual keyword ensures that the derived class's version of the function is used, even when accessed through a base class pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual Destructors: When a base class has a virtual destructor, it ensures that the correct destructors for both the base and derived classes are called when an object is destroyed via a base class pointer. Without a virtual destructor, only the base class's destructor would be called, which could lead to resource leaks if the derived class manages resources.\n",

    "Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the concept of hiding the internal implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary functionalities. In simpler terms, it allows you to focus on \"what\" a class does rather than \"how\" it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, abstract classes are used to achieve abstraction. An abstract class is a class that contains at least one pure virtual function (a virtual function with = 0). These functions are meant to be overridden by derived classes, and the abstract class cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to apply abstraction:\n",
    "Create an abstract base class by defining at least one pure virtual function.\n",
    "Override the pure virtual function in derived classes.\n",
    "You can use pointers or references to the base class to work with derived objects, ensuring that only the necessary functionality is exposed.\n",
