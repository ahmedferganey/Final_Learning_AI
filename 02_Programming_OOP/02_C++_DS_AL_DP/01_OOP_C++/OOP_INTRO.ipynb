    "| **Classes & Objects**    | A class is a user-defined data type serving as a \"blueprint\" for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes and contain attributes (data members) and methods (functions).             | Example: A car object with attributes like weight and color, and methods like `drive()` and `brake()`.                                                                                  |\n",
    "| **Attributes & Methods** | Attributes are variables inside a class, and methods are functions associated with a class. These are often referred to as \"class members\".        | Example: Car class with attributes `color` and `weight`, and method `drive()`.                                                                                                        |\n",

    "| **Encapsulation**        | Hides sensitive data by making attributes private. Public \"get\" and \"set\" methods control access to these attributes.                             | Example: `getWeight()` and `setWeight()` methods to access a private attribute `weight`.                                                                                              |\n",

This enables runtime polymorphism.               | Example: `virtual void makeSound()` in `Animal` base class.

    "| **Virtual Destructors**  | Ensures proper resource cleanup when objects are destroyed via a base class pointer, preventing resource leaks in derived classes.                 | Example: `virtual ~Animal()` destructor in the base class ensures derived class `Dog` destructor is also called.                                                                      |\n",
    "| **Abstraction**          | Hides implementation details, exposing only essential features through abstract classes (classes with at least one pure virtual function).        | Example: Abstract class `Shape` with pure virtual function `draw()`.
