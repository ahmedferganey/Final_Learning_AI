    "**1. Basic Calculator with Compile-Time Evaluation 11.Cpp**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Covers:** Modern C++ code lifecycle, C++ variables, data types, and constexpr.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** Create a simple calculator that performs arithmetic operations. Use constexpr to evaluate expressions at compile-time, optimizing performance. This app will demonstrate the process from writing to executing C++ code with modern C++ improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "constexpr int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `constexpr` in the function definition `constexpr int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }` provides several benefits, primarily related to compile-time evaluation and optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compile-Time Evaluation**: `constexpr` tells the compiler that this function can be evaluated at compile time if the inputs are constants. When `add()` is called with constant values, the compiler can compute the result during compilation, reducing runtime calculations and improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimization**: By computing values at compile time, `constexpr` allows the compiler to avoid generating machine code for the function call in certain cases. This can lead to more optimized, smaller, and faster code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improved Code Safety**: `constexpr` functions help enforce constraints in code. If `add()` is intended for compile-time constants, using `constexpr` ensures this. Trying to use it in an invalid context will generate a compile-time error, catching potential issues early.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Versatility**: `constexpr` functions can still be called at runtime if the inputs arenâ€™t constants, making them versatile. They provide the performance benefits of compile-time evaluation while retaining flexibility for runtime usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, `constexpr` enhances performance by reducing runtime overhead, allows better optimization, and promotes safer, cleaner code by catching certain errors early.\n"
